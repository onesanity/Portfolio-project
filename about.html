            <h1 class="mb-4">Hi, I am Alina Nguyen</h1>
            <h2 class="mb-4">Frontend Developer, based in San Diego, CA.</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Although of Vietnamese heritage, Alina was born and grew up in
              California, USA, where she studied to become a sports therapist,
              which ultimately led her to a career within the yachting industry.
              This allowed her to travel the world and opened her mind to
              different cultures and people, as well as developing her skills in
              areas such as Pilates and Reiki. She developed a hobby for
              photography and quickly became recognized for her particular
              talent in capturing the beauty and essence of people, landscapes
              and cultures around the world in her photographs. Other passions
              include a love of food, from the street food of Bangkok to
              Michelin-starred restaurants. And her lust for adventure,
              discovering new places off the beaten track and finding the magic
              corners of each new place she visits. Music is also something
              that‚Äôs very close to her heart, and family and friends remain an
              integral part of her world wherever she goes. Growing, learning,
              expanding and discovering - physically, mentally and spiritually ‚Äì
              is something she aims for on a daily basis, and this website is an
              opportunity for her to share a little part of her world with you.
